# Chord Builder — Claude Project Memory

Standalone browser-based chord progression composer. Build chords on a piano keyboard, arrange them in a draggable progression, and play them back with a choice of synth voices.

**Live:** https://johnesco.github.io/chord-builder/
**Repo:** https://github.com/Johnesco/chord-builder

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Vanilla, No Build Step
Plain HTML/CSS/JS. No bundler, no framework, no transpilation. Edit a file, refresh the browser. The only external dependencies are two CDN scripts (see below).

### 2. Single-Page App
Everything lives in three files at the repo root:
- `index.html` — markup + CDN scripts
- `style.css` — dark theme, piano layout, playback states
- `app.js` — state, audio, chord detection, rendering

No routing, no server, no backend. State persists to `localStorage`.

### 3. Libraries via CDN (UMD globals)
- **Tone.js** (v14): `Tone.PolySynth` wraps voice classes like `Tone.Synth`, `Tone.FMSynth`, `Tone.AMSynth`, `Tone.PluckSynth`. Notes scheduled via `triggerAttackRelease`. `Tone.Offline()` is used to render WAV exports.
- **Tonal.js** (v5): `Tonal.Chord.detect(pitchClasses)` returns possible chord names for a set of notes.
- **@tonejs/midi** (v2): exposes `Midi` global, used to build and serialize `.mid` files.
- **VexFlow** (v3): exposes `Vex.Flow.*` globals, used to render chord progressions as sheet-music SVG.

## State Shape (`app.js`)

```js
state = {
  chords: [              // array of chord objects (order = playback order)
    {
      id: string,        // unique; generated via uid()
      notes: string[],   // e.g. ['C4', 'E4', 'G4'], max 6, sorted by pitch
      customName: string | null,  // overrides detected name when set
      duration: number,  // BEATS (1 beat = quarter note); 0.0625–16
      articulation: 'block' | 'up' | 'down',  // how notes are struck
      stagger: number    // ms between note onsets when articulation != 'block'; 10–500
    }
  ],
  selectedChordId: string | null,    // the chord shown in the editor
  previousSelectedId: string | null, // preserved across playback
  isPlaying: boolean,
  playingIndex: number,              // -1 when idle, else index into state.chords
  instrument: string,                // key into INSTRUMENTS map
  bpm: number,                       // 40–300; default 120
  timeSignature: { num, den },       // e.g. {num: 4, den: 4}; default 4/4
  synth: Tone.PolySynth | null       // lazily created on first audio gesture
}
```

Persisted keys: `chords`, `selectedChordId`, `instrument`, `bpm`, `timeSignature`. LocalStorage key: `chord-builder-state-v1`.

### Time model — beats, not seconds

Chord duration is in **beats** where 1 beat = a quarter note. Playback seconds are derived via `beatsToSeconds(beats) = beats * (60 / state.bpm)`. This means:

- `duration: 1` at 120 BPM plays for 0.5s; at 60 BPM plays for 1.0s
- The sheet music renders whole/half/quarter/eighth/sixteenth notes using fixed beat thresholds in `durationToVex()`
- Chord cards display "1 beat" / "2 beats" / fractional values via `formatBeats()`
- MIDI export sets tempo + time-signature meta so DAWs open the file at the right speed/bar layout
- WAV export converts beats to seconds at current BPM before offline-rendering

### Articulation — block / arpeggio up / arpeggio down

Each chord has an `articulation` field (`'block' | 'up' | 'down'`) and a `stagger` value (milliseconds between consecutive note onsets). Playback, WAV, and MIDI all share the same scheduling contract via `scheduleChord(synth, chord, absoluteStartTime)`:

- **block** — all notes triggered at `absoluteStartTime` with the full chord duration
- **up** — notes sorted low-to-high, each offset by `stagger * index`
- **down** — notes reversed high-to-low, each offset by `stagger * index`

Each note's release is aligned to the chord window end (`noteDur = durationSec - offset`), so earlier notes sustain while later notes enter, producing a natural arpeggio. If the cumulative stagger would exceed the chord window, offsets clamp to `durationSec - 0.05` so every note still starts inside the slot.

The sheet renderer adds a `Vex.Flow.Stroke` modifier (`ROLL_UP` / `ROLL_DOWN`) to arpeggiated chord noteheads, which draws the wavy vertical line before the chord. Block chords get no stroke.

MIDI export inlines the same staggering directly in `track.addNote({ time, duration })` calls rather than going through `scheduleChord` (since MIDI uses note-event times, not synth triggers).

### Migration from the pre-beats format

Older localStorage shapes had `duration` in seconds and no `bpm` field. On load:
1. If `data.bpm` is missing, `state.bpm` is forced to **60**.
2. Raw `duration` numbers are kept as-is.

Result: "1.0" is now interpreted as 1 beat, but at 60 BPM that still plays for 1 second — same audible length as before the refactor. Users keep their progressions with zero perceived change; only the units shown in the UI shift.

## Key Patterns

### Lazy Audio Init
`Tone.start()` must be called from a user gesture (browser autoplay policy). `ensureAudio()` awaits `Tone.start()` then lazily constructs the synth via `initSynth()`. Called before any note trigger.

### Instrument Swap Mid-Playback
Playback uses `setTimeout` (not `Tone.Transport.schedule`) so each chord's trigger reads `state.synth` **at fire time**, not at scheduling time. When the user changes instrument:
1. `setInstrument()` disposes the current synth
2. Creates a new one (if audio context is already running)
3. Next scheduled chord fires on the new synth

Trade-off: setTimeout timing is slightly less precise than Tone.Transport, but for chord-duration (≥0.1s) ticks it's fine, and it enables clean hot-swapping.

### Editor Sync During Playback
`state.selectedChordId` is set to the playing chord on each tick, so the piano key highlights and info panel update in real time. On playback end (or stop), `state.previousSelectedId` is restored so the user's pre-play selection returns.

### Editor Lock During Playback
- JS: every mutator (`addChord`, `removeChord`, `moveChord`, `toggleNote`, `clearNotes`, input handlers) guards with `if (state.isPlaying) return;`
- CSS: `body.is-playing` disables `pointer-events` on `.chord-card`, `.piano-wrapper`, `.editor-controls`, `.chord-info`
- Instrument select stays live (the whole point of the feature)

### Chord Detection
`detectChordNames(notes)` strips octaves (`C4` → `C`), dedupes, and passes to `Tonal.Chord.detect(pcs)`. Returns an array like `["CM"]` or `["CM7", "Em#5/C"]`. First result is used as the default display name; `customName` overrides.

### Piano Layout
White keys render in a flex row inside `#piano`. Black keys are absolutely positioned on top using `BLACK_NOTE_AFTER` offsets:

```
blackKeyLeft = (globalWhiteIdx + 1) * WHITE_KEY_WIDTH - BLACK_KEY_WIDTH / 2
```

where `globalWhiteIdx = (octave - startOctave) * 7 + whiteIdx`.

Current range: C3 – C5 (two octaves plus a trailing C).

## Instrument Presets (`INSTRUMENTS`)

Eight voices defined in `app.js`. Each maps to a Tone.js voice class name (resolved at runtime via `Tone[name]`) plus options:

| Key | Voice Class | Character |
|---|---|---|
| `piano` | `Synth` (triangle) | Mellow default |
| `organ` | `AMSynth` | Sustained |
| `strings` | `Synth` (sine, slow attack) | Pad-like |
| `brass` | `Synth` (sawtooth) | Bright |
| `flute` | `Synth` (sine, medium attack) | Airy |
| `guitar` | `PluckSynth` | String pluck |
| `bell` | `FMSynth` | Metallic |
| `chiptune` | `Synth` (square) | 8-bit |

Adding a new preset: add an entry to `INSTRUMENTS` and a matching `<option>` in `index.html`. `createSynth()` handles the rest.

## Development

### Local serving
```bash
cd c:/code/chord-builder && python -m http.server 8080
```
Visit http://localhost:8080/

Any static server works. The file: protocol works too, but CDN scripts may behave better over HTTP.

### Deployment
GitHub Pages serves from `main` branch root.

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "..."
git push
```

Pages rebuilds automatically (~30s). Check status:

```bash
"C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe" api repos/Johnesco/chord-builder/pages/builds/latest
```

### gh CLI Path (Windows)
`gh` is not on PATH. Full path: `C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe`

## Instructions for Claude

### Tone and style
- Edit in place; keep the three-file structure unless a feature genuinely requires more.
- No build step. No npm. No framework. If a library helps (audio DSP, music theory), load it via CDN.
- Dark theme is deliberate — don't invert it without asking.
- Match existing CSS variable usage (`--accent`, `--bg-card`, etc.).

### When changing playback
- Always account for the instrument-swap case (synth referenced fresh at fire time).
- Always restore `previousSelectedId` on both clean end AND user-triggered stop.
- Keep the editor-lock invariant (mutators check `state.isPlaying`).

### Safety
- `escapeHtml()` for any user-entered text rendered into the DOM (chord custom names).
- No `innerHTML` with unescaped user input.

## Export Features

### WAV
`exportWav()` uses `Tone.Offline()` to render the progression to an `AudioBuffer` using the current instrument preset, then encodes to 16-bit PCM WAV via the in-file `audioBufferToWav()` encoder (no extra dependency). Downloaded as `chord-progression.wav`.

Render window = total progression length + 2s tail for release.

### MIDI
`exportMidi()` builds a `Midi` object from `@tonejs/midi`. Each chord becomes one simultaneous group of notes; chord durations map directly (in seconds) to MIDI note durations. `track.instrument.number` is set from `GM_INSTRUMENTS[state.instrument]` so a DAW opens the file with roughly the right patch.

### Sheet Music
`renderSheet()` draws SVG via VexFlow into a modal as a **grand staff** (treble + bass joined by a brace). Each chord's notes split by `MIDDLE_C_MIDI` (60 / C4): notes at or above middle C render on the treble stave, below on the bass. When a clef has no notes for a given chord, a rest of matching duration is placed there. Chord display names are annotated above the treble row only (not doubled on the bass) for a consistent top line of labels.

Layout is driven by the time signature: `groupChordsIntoMeasures()` accumulates chords greedily until their beats sum reaches `state.timeSignature.num`, then starts a new measure. `SHEET_MEASURES_PER_SYSTEM` (= 2) measures per system; a `Vex.Flow.BarNote` is inserted between measures within a system so the Formatter draws an internal bar line. The time signature is shown on the first system only. Accidentals added per note via `addAccidental`. Brace + left/right StaveConnectors bound each system.

Long chords crossing measure boundaries aren't tied across barlines yet — they're placed entirely in whichever measure the greedy grouper lands them in. This is a known v1 simplification.

Duration mapping: seconds to VexFlow note values assuming 60 BPM (1s = 1 beat). Anything ≥ 3s = whole, ≥ 1.5s = half, ≥ 0.75s = quarter, ≥ 0.375s = eighth, else sixteenth.

Printing: the Print button adds `body.printing-sheet`, which a `@media print` block uses to hide everything except the modal's sheet body. `afterprint` removes the class. "Save as PDF" is available by choosing it as the print destination.

## What This Project Is NOT
- Not a DAW. No multi-track, no mixing, no export-to-audio.
- Not a sheet-music editor. No notation rendering.
- Not a lesson platform. No theory instruction, no exercises.
- Not a real-time jam tool. No MIDI input, no latency tuning beyond browser defaults.

It's a focused "compose a chord progression, hear it, and take it with you" web toy — playback in-browser, export to WAV/MIDI/sheet-music for anywhere else.
